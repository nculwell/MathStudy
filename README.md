# MathStudy

Info on resources for studying math, stats, CS, etc.

I created this list for my own studies. I haven't read most of the books here yet, and probably never will read most of them. I've made it visible to the public, though, in case anyone else finds it useful. I make no promises: it may be full of bad advice and it probably contains some erroneous statements about points of fact.

Keep in mind that I'm not very familiar with some of these subjects, so my organization might not make any sense. I usually start out by just collecting a bunch of titles, then I organize them as I begin to figure out how a typical sequence of study in that subfield should proceed.

I hope to make the list more complete in the future, but for now, there are some subjects that are left out for no good reason. I also hope in the future to present a simpler list of "here's a list of books you can work through to cover all these subjects without repeating the same material too much or spending too much money".

## Annotations

[I've stopped bothering with this, since now I just link to Amazon or other listings for the books where you can see prices, but there are still some annotations hanging around so I'm leaving the legend here for now.]

- (u) - This book is very expensive (price > $100), but used copies can be bought for a reasonable price.
- (x) - This book is very expensive (price > $100), and used copies *cannot* [at the time of writing] be bought for a reasonable price.
- (f) - This book is available free online.
- (i) - This book is very expensive (price > $100), but there is an affordable international edition.
- (c) - This book is relatively inexpensive (price < $30) when bought new.
- (o) - An acceptable edition of this book that's previous to the current one but not terribly out of date can be bought for considerably cheaper than the current edition.

## Sections

I'm not sure how well I chose the sections here, but at least they break the list up into more manageable chunks.
